what is crossorigin:
CORS comes into play when your app needs to request resources from a different origin. For example, let's say your React app is running on http://localhost:3000, and it needs to fetch data from an API running on http://localhost:5000.

 The primary goal of a CDN is to reduce latency and improve the overall performance of websites and web applications.
