<h1>what is the difference between Named Export, Default EXport and * as Export ? </h1>
If you only need to export a single value from a module, or if the module represents a main feature of your application, use export default .
If you need to export multiple values from a module, or if you want to organize your code into smaller, reusable components, use export with named exports surrounded in {} braces.
:In * as export it is used to import the whole module as a component & access the components inside the module.
<h1>What is the importance of config.js file?</h1>
Config. js allows developers to configure their applications in an XML block instead of hard-coding values inside their scripts or in JSON objects. The XML can be embedded inside an HTML document or in a separate XML file. The configuration block may contain strings, numbers, arrays and HTML.
 <h1>What are React Hooks?</h1>
React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects. React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks: useState : To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.

useState -> manage state & return stateful value & an updater function to update it.
useEffect -> manage side-effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, mutuation and more.
useContext -> return a current value for a context
useCallback -> return a memorized version of a callback to help child component not re-render unncessarily
useMemo -> return a memoized value that helps in performance optimization
useRef -> It return a ref object with a current property. The ref object is mutable. It is mainly used to access a child component imperatively.
useReducer -> used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second.
<h1>why do we need useState hook?</h1>
The React useState Hook allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function, and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.

use State is super power varaiable in react  it is superpower for react
